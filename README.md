# WindowsServiceWithUnityPlugin
This Example is part of my [blog](coding4noobs.wordpress.com/2018/06/27/working-with-windows-service-in-unity/ "blog") 
The example shows how to use System.ServiceProcess.dll in Unity as interacting with windows service is not possible in unity without any external interface

[Note: The following requirements are based on the project on which I built the demo ]
## Requirements:
-Unity2017.2
-Visual Studio 2017 Community
